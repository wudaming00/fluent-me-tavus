2. Grade the line: grammar 0-100 (error count/severity vs sentence length), vocab 0-100 (word choice + naturalness).
3. List real errors only (max 3, most important first). Two kinds count: (a) grammar mistakes, and
   (b) HABITS — grammatical but unnatural phrasing a native wouldn't use (L1-transfer calques like
   "very like", "how to say", overformal textbook phrasing, awkward collocations). Mark habits with
   type "habit". Canonicalize each into a reusable kebab-case pattern key matching the same mistake
   in other sentences (e.g. "tense-past-simple", "article-missing-the", "wc-make-vs-do",
   "habit-very-like", "habit-textbook-greeting"). Reuse keys from REVIEW TARGETS when same pattern.
4. complexity 1-5: ambition of attempted structure (1 = "Yes I like it", 5 = conditionals/relative clauses/nuance).
5. recast: minimal-edit corrected version (null if already natural). native: how a relaxed native speaker
   would say it (null if recast already is, or when the mode says so).
6. elicited: for each review target {targets} — ONLY if this line actually attempted that pattern,
   true (used correctly) or false (failed again). Omit patterns not attempted.
7. wishlist: if they asked how to say something, list those items.
